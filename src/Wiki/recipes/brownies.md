# Fudgy Brownies

## Ingredients

  * 3/4 cup (12 Tbsp; 175g) unsalted butter
  * one 4 ounce (113g) semi-sweet chocolate bar, coarsely chopped*
  * 2 cups (400g) granulated sugar*
  * 3 large eggs, at room temperature
  * 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
  * 1 cup (82g) unsweetened natural or dutch-process cocoa powder*
  * 1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
  * 1 teaspoon salt
  * optional: 1 and 1/4 cups (225g) semi-sweet chocolate chips

## Steps

  * Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) and grease a 9×13 inch pan or line with aluminum foil or parchment paper, leaving an overhang on the sides to lift the finished brownies out (makes cutting easier!). Set aside.
  * In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter and 2 ounces of chopped chocolate. Melt in 30 second increments, whisking after each, until completely smooth. Whisk in the sugar until completely combined, then whisk in the eggs and vanilla. The batter will be light brown and a little dull looking.
  * Add the cocoa powder, flour, salt, remaining 2 ounces of chopped chocolate and the chocolate chips. Fold it all together with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Batter will be very thick. Spread evenly into prepared pan.
  * Bake for 30 minutes, then test the brownies with a toothpick. Insert it into the center of the pan. If it comes out with wet batter, the brownies are not done. If there are only a few moist crumbs, the brownies are done. Keep checking every 2 minutes until you have moist crumbs. My brownies take 31-32 minutes.
  * Remove from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool completely in the pan before cutting into squares.
  * Cover and store leftover brownies at room temperature for up to 1 week.

### How to Tell When Brownies are Done Baking

This can be tricky, so here’s how to determine when these brownies are done. Turn the timer to 30 minutes as soon as the brownies go into the oven. Once you begin to smell that captivating scent of chocolate permeate through the kitchen, check the brownies. Even if this is at the 25 minute mark. Use a toothpick, stick it into the center, and pull it out. The brownies need more time if there is wet batter on the toothpick. If there are a few moist crumbs on the toothpick, the brownies are done. You don’t want a clean toothpick! (That’s an odd sentence, but you get me!)
