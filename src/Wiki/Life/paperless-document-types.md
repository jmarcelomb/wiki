### How to Customize Furtwher
- Adapt the list to match your specific needs. For example, if you have a side business, you might add a "Business Documents" type.  
- Combine or split categories if one seems too broad or too specific.  
- Consider your future needs (e.g., maintaining tax-relevant documents for a few years).  

These broad categories will help you maintain structure while staying flexible enough to accommodate most documents you encounter in daily life. Over time, you can refine your document types based on usage patterns.
