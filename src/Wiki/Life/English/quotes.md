“Inside you are two wolves. One is made of fear, hate, and despair. The other is made of love, hope, and courage. Every day, they fight for control. The one who wins is the one you feed.”

“The desire to hold onto past situations and people only leads us back to a place where we do not belong.
We should be grateful when people enter our lives and grateful when they leave because they make way for new people. We have no control over anything on this planet except ourselves, and it is a disservice to decorate your old ruins.”

	"I hope that, eventually, you’ll realize this life isn’t merely a twist of fate. It was meant for you. Your purpose. A purpose that resonates with every living being. Whether we like it or not, we hold the reins of our own destiny. Nothing is predetermined. And while our intentions may be noble, they are overshadowed by the influence of our actions. Any aspiration for a brighter future stems from actively creating that future. One that mirrors the goodness within us. And that goodness is reflected in how we treat others. We all share a common destiny — a shared future shaped by our countless choices. One potential future is grounded in kindness, trust, and understanding, if we choose to embrace it. We move forward, unwavering, toward a light we cannot yet see. This is not just for those we cherish, but also for those we may never encounter."
	- Luther’s final words in Mission Impossible — The Final Reckoning.

	"It’s okay to have feelings, you know. Things that aren’t logical. Science makes us understand how to stay alive longer. Feelings give us the reason to want to."

	"Life is precious because you can’t watch it again. I mean, you can believe in an afterlife if that makes you feel better. Doesn’t mean it’s true. But once you realize you’re not gonna be around forever, I think that’s what makes life so magical. One day you’ll eat your last meal, smell your last flower, hug your friend for the very last time. You might not know it’s the last time, so that’s why you should do everything you love with passion, you know? Treasure the few years you’ve got because that’s all there is."
	
	"Nothing's as good if you don't share it."

	Life is like a ride at the fair. Exciting, scary, fast. And you can only go round once. You have the best time till you can’t take any more. Then it slows down, and you see someone else waiting to get on. They need your seat."

	"There are no bad dogs, just bad owners. If you treat a dog bad and show them no love, that’s what they act like. If you show them kindness and hope, they’re fine. It’s the same with people."

	"You can't control the wind, but you can adjust your sails"

**Meaning:** In life, there are things we can't control, just like the wind. But here's the empowering part: we have the ability to adapt and change our course. It's like adjusting the sails of a boat—we can always find a way to navigate through challenges and rough waters.

There are two quotes about the marriage that I really like and I truly think they are wise and in some way helpful. Perhaps you'll like them as wel:
	
	1."Love is not a feeling. It's a choice" 
*Meaning:* if you truly want your marriage/relationship to be healthy, well-organised and fruitful then you literally have to make a choice to love someone.

It's not a wild feeling you can't control. A mature love is a way of life you both agreed upon and you both maintain. At least this is how I understand it.
	
	2. "In relationship all the duties should not be divided 50/50. They should be divided 60/40, but both sides should try to be the 60% part"
this one is simple and lovely :)
