	"You can't control the wind, but you can adjust your sails"

**Meaning:** In life, there are things we can't control, just like the wind. But here's the empowering part: we have the ability to adapt and change our course. It's like adjusting the sails of a boat‚Äîwe can always find a way to navigate through challenges and rough waters.

There are two quotes about the marriage that I really like and I truly think they are wise and in some way helpful. Perhaps you'll like them as wel:
	
	1."Love is not a feeling. It's a choice" 
*Meaning:* if you truly want your marriage/relationship to be healthy, well-organised and fruitful then you literally have to make a choice to love someone.

It's not a wild feeling you can't control. A mature love is a way of life you both agreed upon and you both maintain. At least this is how I understand it.
	
	2. "In relationship all the duties should not be divided 50/50. They should be divided 60/40, but both sides should try to be the 60% part"
this one is simple and lovely :)

	‚ÄúWhen nobody else celebrates you, learn to celebrate yourself. When nobody else compliments you, then compliment yourself. It‚Äôs not up to other people to keep you encouraged. It‚Äôs up to you. Encouragement should come from the inside.‚Äù
