	"It‚Äôs okay to have feelings, you know. Things that aren‚Äôt logical. Science makes us understand how to stay alive longer. Feelings give us the reason to want to."
	
	"Live your life as if there‚Äôs no tomorrow, and then you wake up and there is a tomorrow and you do it again."
	
	"Women are better than men. And they never stop trying to bring us up to their standard."

	"You can‚Äôt change the world, but you can change yourself."
	
	"Life is precious because you can‚Äôt watch it again. I mean, you can believe in an afterlife if that makes you feel better. Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. But once you realize you‚Äôre not gonna be around forever, I think that‚Äôs what makes life so magical. One day you‚Äôll eat your last meal, smell your last flower, hug your friend for the very last time. You might not know it‚Äôs the last time, so that‚Äôs why you should do everything you love with passion, you know? Treasure the few years you‚Äôve got because that‚Äôs all there is."
	
	"Nothing's as good if you don't share it."
	
	"A society grows great when old men plant tree whose shade they know they shall never sit in."

	"My dad used to say:
	Life is like a ride at the fair. Exciting, scary, fast. And you can only go round once. You have the best time till you can‚Äôt take any more. Then it slows down, and you see someone else waiting to get on. They need your seat."

	"There are no bad dogs, just bad owners. If you treat a dog bad and show them no love, that‚Äôs what they act like. If you show them kindness and hope, they‚Äôre fine. It‚Äôs the same with people."

	"You can't control the wind, but you can adjust your sails"

**Meaning:** In life, there are things we can't control, just like the wind. But here's the empowering part: we have the ability to adapt and change our course. It's like adjusting the sails of a boat‚Äîwe can always find a way to navigate through challenges and rough waters.

There are two quotes about the marriage that I really like and I truly think they are wise and in some way helpful. Perhaps you'll like them as wel:
	
	1."Love is not a feeling. It's a choice" 
*Meaning:* if you truly want your marriage/relationship to be healthy, well-organised and fruitful then you literally have to make a choice to love someone.

It's not a wild feeling you can't control. A mature love is a way of life you both agreed upon and you both maintain. At least this is how I understand it.
	
	2. "In relationship all the duties should not be divided 50/50. They should be divided 60/40, but both sides should try to be the 60% part"
this one is simple and lovely :)

	‚ÄúWhen nobody else celebrates you, learn to celebrate yourself. When nobody else compliments you, then compliment yourself. It‚Äôs not up to other people to keep you encouraged. It‚Äôs up to you. Encouragement should come from the inside.‚Äù
