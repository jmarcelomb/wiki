# Welcome to my Wiki!🌟

Hey there, and thanks for stopping by! 😊

Here, you’ll find a collection of guides, cheat sheets, and projects that I've curated throughout my journey as an engineer and lifelong learner. Whether it’s embedded systems, Linux kernel development, or just cool little hacks, I love sharing the things that make life easier for me (and hopefully for you too!).

## 🚀 About Me
I’m an embedded software engineer with a passion for building robust, efficient systems. From low-power IoT devices to cutting-edge Linux kernel modules, I’m all about learning, creating, and sharing knowledge.

## 🔍 What You'll Find Here
- Handy **cheat sheets** and **how-to guides** for tools and technologies.
- Nuggets of wisdom from my adventures in **C**, **Rust**, **Python**, and more!
- A mix of work-related resources and personal tinkering projects.
